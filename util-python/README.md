# Utility

The purpose of this python project is to perform all the side-tasks for the thesis project.
For example, creating the figures for the code coverage.

## Setup
The project was using a Python 3.10 interpreter. However, a lower version of Python is not expected to create issues.

Import the python packages using:

```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

Run the file from the folder itself like the following:

```commandline
python3 src/coverage.py
```
